This C program takes an integer input n and prints either "Motu" or "Patlu" based on certain conditions. Here is the pseudo code for the given code:

Declare integers n, p, m, and i
Read an integer n from user
Initialize i = 1
While i is less than or equal to n:
    if n is greater than or equal to i:
        p = i
        n = n - p
    else:
        p = n
    if n is greater than or equal to 2 * i:
        m = i * 2
        n = n - m
    else:
        m = n
    Increment i
If p is greater than m:
    Print "Motu"
Else:
    Print "Patlu"
